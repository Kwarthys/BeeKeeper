# BeeKeeper

### Content

You will find in this repository all the tools used by this project:
- **Beekeeper** is the root folder of the Ecplise project, running the simulation and the servers for communications.
- **pythonAnalytics** contains all the scripts used earlier this year to measure the effectiveness of the project.
- **TestClientBeekeeper** is the Unity project responsible for the final display of the simulation. It's a huge WIP as we are only starting it. It recieves and sends instructions from/to the java server.
