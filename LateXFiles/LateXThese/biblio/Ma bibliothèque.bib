	shorttitle = {The tremble dance of the honey bee},
	abstract = {The nectar foragers of a honey bee colony, upon return to the hive, sometimes perform a mysterious behavior called the tremble dance. In performing this dance, a forager shakes her body back and forth, at the same time rotating her body axis by about 50° every second or so, all the while walking slowly across the comb. During the course of a dance, which on average lasts 30 rain, the bee travels about the broodnest portion of the hive. It is shown experimentally that a forager will reliably perform this dance if she visits a highly profitable nectar source but upon return to the hive experiences great difficulty finding a food-storer bee to take her nectar. This suggests that the message of the tremble dance is " I have visited a rich nectar source worthy of greater exploitation, but already we have more nectar coming into the hive than we can handle." It is also shown experimentally that the performance of tremble dances is followed quickly by a rise in a colony's nectar processing capacity and (see Nieh, in press and Kirchner, submitted) by a drop in a colony's recruitment of additional bees to nectar sources. These findings suggest that the tremble dance has multiple meanings. For bees working inside the hive, its meaning is apparently "I should switch to the task of processing nectar," while for bees working outside the hive (gathering nectar), its meaning is apparently " I should refrain from recruiting additional foragers to my nectar source." Hence it appears that the tremble dance functions as a mechanism for keeping a colony's nectar processing rate matched with its nectar intake rate at times of greatly increased nectar influx. Evidently the tremble dance restores this match in part by stimulating a rise in the processing rate, and in part by inhibiting any further rise in the intake rate.},

	abstract = {La problematique generale qui oriente notre travail concerne la capacite de groupes d'agents a s'auto-organiser pour produire des reponses fonctionnelles collectives. Elle s'insere dans la problematique plus vaste de l'intelligence artificielle distribuee, qui est de faire fonctionner de maniere cooperative des agents informatiques au sein de systemes multi-agents. Nous nous interessons plus particulierement a l'emergence de ces reponses au sein de groupes d'agents non-intelligents individuellement, encore appeles agents reactifs. Ce choix necessite de comprendre les comportements individuels et inter-individuels qui permettent l'apparition et le maintien d'une dynamique collective alors meme qu'aucun agent n'est capable de penser cette dynamique. Comme les travaux theoriques portant sur l'auto-organisation ou l'emergence de proprietes sont encore loin d'etre finalises, le point de vue que nous defendons ici est qu'il est possible de s'inspirer de processus auto-organises existants pour construire des logiciels exploitant ces proprietes. Pour cela, deux types d'etudes ont ete realisees: ? une etude de simulation s'attachant a reproduire le fonctionnement d'une colonie de fourmis en utilisant un systeme reactif, ou chaque fourmi est representee dans le systeme par un agent possedant un comportement du type stimulus/reponse. Nous reproduisons fidelement, avec ce systeme totalement decentralise, la dynamique de fondation d'une societe et la structuration de l'ensemble des agents-fourmis au sein d'une division globale du travail. Outre que ces resultats nous fournissent l'occasion de montrer le large champ d'application d'une approche multi-agents de la simulation, ils peuvent etre interpretes comme la reponse fonctionnelle et auto-organisee d'un groupe d'agents aux problemes que lui pose son environnement. ?la seconde etude developpe dans le domaine de la resolution de problemes cette capacite auto-organisatrice, en s'attachant tout d'abord a extraire de la simulation realisee les paradigmes qui nous fournissent la base d'un systeme de resolution collective de problemes. Nous montrons ainsi comment concevoir des systemes reactifs capables de resoudre des problemes comme le tri collectif ou la recherche d'echantillons dans un environnement aleatoire, en s'inspirant directement des comportements des agents-fourmis de la simulation. Nous montrons ensuite qu'une approche reactive peut etre appliquee a des problemes classiques en intelligence artificielle, comme pengi et le taquin, en offrant de bien meilleurs resultats que toutes les approches precedemment employees. Nous en montrons cependant aussi les limites potentielles, notamment dans le cadre du jeu d'echecs},

The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.},

The algorithm is based on local interactions of agents and is inspired by honeybee age-polyethism. It is adaptive to changes in the swarm size (workforce) and relative demands (workload) for diﬀerent tasks and it limits the number of switchings of agents between diﬀerent tasks enabling specialization of agents. The preliminary version of the algorithm was introduced in the past. Here a fully decentralized version of the algorithm is proposed that improves the previous version by removing the need to global information. The algorithm is successfully implemented in swarms of physically-embodied underwater robots while the swarm size and the demands for the tasks change over the course of the experiments.},

	abstract = {As organisms develop, they first invest resources in survival and growth, but after reaching a certain condition they start to also invest in reproduction. Likewise, superorganisms, such as honey bee colonies, first invest in survival and growth, and later commit resources to reproduction once the number of workers in the colony surpasses a reproductive threshold. The first form of reproductive investment for a honey bee colony is the building of beeswax comb made of special large cells used for rearing males (drones). How do the workers sense that their colony is large enough to start building this ‘drone comb’? To address this question, we experimentally increased three possible cues of colony size – worker density, volatile pheromone concentration and nest temperature – and looked for effects on the bees’ comb construction. Only the colonies that experienced increased worker density were stimulated to build a higher proportion of drone comb. We then monitored and quantified potential cues in small and large colonies, to determine which cues change with colony size. We found that workers in large colonies, relative to small ones, have increased contact rates, spend more time active and experience less variable worker density. Whereas unicellular and multicellular organisms use mainly chemical cues to sense their sizes, our results suggest that at least one superorganism, a honey bee colony, uses physical cues to sense its size and thus its developmental state.},

A central objective in the study of honey bee sociality therefore is to understand the communication signals used to integrate behavior within and among worker groups. This paper focuses on the role of the “vibration signal” in organizing labor in honey bee colonies. The vibration signal functions as a type of “modulatory communication signal”. It is directed toward diverse recipients, causes a non-specific increase in activity that may alter responsiveness to a wide array of stimuli, and thus may influence the performance of many different tasks simultaneously. We review the empirical evidence that the signal is involved in coordinating at least three colony-level activities: food collection and foraging-dependent tasks, queen behavior during swarming and queen replacement, and house hunting by honey bee swarms. Signals that function like the vibration signal may be widespread in highly social insects and social animals in general, and may help to fine-tune the collective decision-making processes that underlie cooperative actions in a wide array of species.},

Colonies were subjected to one of four requeening treatments: requeened in mid-summer with a mated, virgin or colony-reared queen, or left with the original queen (control). Worker survival in cohorts of newly emerged bees introduced to colonies in late summer and fall was followed until all marked bees had died. Winter bees were reared over a relatively similar length of time in all treatments, but they appeared earlier in control colonies compared to requeened colonies. The gradual increase in proportion of winter bees over time was similar among treatments, but requeened colonies lagged behind control colonies. The bulk of winter bees appeared much earlier in control colonies than in colonies that were requeened. This response demonstrates that cues within the colony (i.e., differences due to requeening) are perceived by workers as part of the conditions that influence summer bee or winter bee status.},

	abstract = {Homeostatic self-regulation is a fundamental aspect of open dissipative systems. Integral feedback has been found to be important for homeostatic control on both the cellular and molecular levels of biological organization and in engineered systems. Analyzing the task allocation mechanisms of three insect societies, we identified a model of integral control residing at colony level. We characterized a general functional core mechanism, called the “common stomach,” where a crucial shared substance for colony function self-regulates its own quantity via reallocating the colony’s workforce, which collects and uses this substance. The central component in a redundant feedback network is the saturation level of this substance in the colony. An interaction network of positive and negative feedback loops ensures the homeostatic state of this substance and the workforce involved in processing this substance. Extensive sensitivity and stability analyses of the core model revealed that the system is very resilient against perturbations and compensates for specific types of stress that real colonies face in their ecosystems. The core regulation system is highly scalable, and due to its buffer function, it can filter noise and find a new equilibrium quickly after environmental (supply) or colony-state (demand) changes. The common stomach regulation system is an example of convergent evolution among the three different societies, and we predict that similar integral control regulation mechanisms have evolved frequently within natural complex systems.},

	abstract = {We observed the impact of bad pollen supply (non-foraging due to arti®cial rain and pollen removal under poor-foraging conditions) on the survival of honey bee larvae, and on the total development time from egg-laying to the capping of a larval cell. Five days of non-foraging led to cannibalism of larvae younger than 3 days old and to a shortening of the time until larvae were sealed, but 4- and 5-day-old larvae survived even worse pollen supply situations. Manual pollen removal and reduction of income (pollen trap) induced cannibalism of younger larvae. The larvae's mean capping age signi®cantly correlated with the mean pollen income: the less pollen was stored by the hive during the larvae's development, the earlier the larvae were capped. Both behavioral patterns lead to a quick reduction in the amount of unsealed older brood in response to a shortage of available protein. Older larvae have the highest pollen demand, so this strategy compensates for a shortage of supply by reducing demand. Additionally worker jelly gets enriched by protein gained from cannibalism, and the early capping of older larvae saves the oldest part of the brood, which represents the highest broodcare investment.},

In this work we present Serendipity, a new technique for recognizing unremarkable and fine-motor finger gestures using integrated motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in off-the-shelf smartwatches. Our system demonstrates the potential to distinguish 5 fine-motor gestures like pinching, tapping and rubbing fingers with an average f1-score of 87\%. Our work is the first to explore the feasibility of using solely motion sensors on everyday wearable devices to detect fine-grained gestures. This promising technology can be deployed today on current smartwatches and has the potential to be applied to cross-device interactions, or as a tool for research in fields involving finger and hand motion.},

Response thresholds refer to the likelihood of reacting to task-associated stimuli. Low-threshold individuals perform tasks at a lower level of stimulus than high-threshold individuals. Within individual workers, performing a given task induces a decrease in the corresponding threshold, and not performing the task induces an increase in the threshold. This combined reinforcement process leads to the emergence of specialized workers, i.e. workers that are more responsive to stimuli associated with particular task requirements, from a group of initially identical individuals. Predictions of the dynamics of task specialization resulting from this model are presented. Predictions are also made as to what should be observed when specialists of a given task are removed from the colony and reintroduced after a varying amount of time: the colony does not recover the same state as that prior to the perturbation, and the difference between before and after the perturbation is more strongly marked as the time between separation and reintroduction increases.},

Researchers have shown that division of labor can emerge in homogeneous populations predicated on the system's environment and the distribution of agent task bias. This article demonstrates that the emergence of division of labor in homogenous populations is also impacted by agent decision functions, agent population size, and environmental constraints. Results show, one, agent decision functions and population size have a significant impact on the division of labor scores, whereas, the influence of environmental constraints depends upon the chosen agent decision function. Two, results indicate that high division of labor scores do not necessarily translate to higher resource production, which, again, appears tied to agent decision functions. Three, although agent population size possesses a positive correlation to division of labor scores, agent decision functions play a more critical role in its emergence.},

Studies of division of labor are concerned with the integration of individual worker behavior into colony level task organization and with the question of how regulation of division of labor may contribute to colony efficiency. Here we describe and critique the current models concerned with the proximate causes of division of labor in social insects. The models have identified various proximate mechanisms to explain division of labor, based on both internal and external factors. On the basis of these factors, we suggest a classification of the models. We first describe the different types of models and then review the empirical evidence supporting them. The models to date may be considered preliminary and exploratory; they have advanced our understanding by suggesting possible mechanisms for division of labor and by revealing how individual and colony-level behavior may be related. They suggest specific hypotheses that can be tested by experiment and so may lead to the development of more powerful and integrative explanatory models.},

Alife approaches to the origins and emergence of language typically manage this complexity by carefully staging the learning paths that embodied artiﬁcial agents need to follow in order to bootstrap their own communication system from scratch. This paper investigates how these scaffolds introduced by the experimenter can be removed by allowing agents to autonomously set their own challenges when they are driven by intrinsic motivation and have the capacity to self-assess their own skills at achieving their communicative goals. The results suggest that intrinsic motivation not only allows agents to spontaneously develop their own learning paths, but also that they are able to make faster transitions from one learning phase to the next.},

Layers are made up of asynchronous modules which communicate over low bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings.

While the ability of the commonly used reactive techniques to express agent speciﬁcations is roughly equivalent, the authorial burden of constructing these speciﬁcations varies. In practice, this means that identical agent behavior may be more difﬁcult to create in some architectures than others. In this paper we introduce the notion of representational complexity that relates to the authorial burden of constructing such agents and theoretically compare the representational complexity of ﬁnite state machines, behavior trees, and subsumption architectures. Our key ﬁnding is that hierarchical subsumption architectures have signiﬁcantly lower representational complexity as compared to hierarchical ﬁnite state machines and behavior trees, which makes subsumption the best choice when developing authoring tools for non-expert users.},

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.},

	abstract = {Effective data visualization is a key part of the discovery process in the era of “big data”. It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path from data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional “desktop” visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.},

The algorithm is fully distributed and solely based on the local perceptions of the individuals. Each agent decides autonomously and deterministically to work only when it “feels” that some work needs to be done based on its sensory inputs. In this paper, we applied the worker allocation algorithm to a collective manipulation case study concerned with the gathering and clustering of initially scattered small objects. The aggregation experiment has been studied at three different experimental levels by using macroscopic and microscopic probabilistic models, and embodied simulations. Results show that teams using a number of active workers dynamically controlled by the allocation algorithm achieve similar or better performances in aggregation than those characterized by a constant team size, while using a considerably reduced number of agents over the whole aggregation process. Since this algorithm does not imply any form of explicit communication among agents, it represents a cost-effective solution for controlling the number of active workers in embedded systems consisting of a few to thousands of units.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present three scalable, fully distributed, threshold-based algorithms for allocating autonomous embodied workers to a given task whose demand evolves dynamically over time. Individuals estimate the availability of work based solely on local perceptions. The differences among the algorithms lie in the threshold distribution among teammates (homogeneous or heterogeneous team), in the mechanism used for establishing threshold values (fixed, parameter-based or variable, rule-based), and in the sharing (public) or not sharing (private) of demand estimations through local peer-to-peer communication. We tested the algorithms’ efficiency and robustness in a collective manipulation case study concerned with the clustering of initially scattered small objects. The aggregation experiment has been studied at two different experimental levels using a microscopic model and embodied simulations. Results show that teams using a number of active workers dynamically controlled by one of the allocation algorithms achieve similar or better performances in aggregation than those characterized by a constant team size while using on average a considerably reduced number of agents over the whole aggregation process. While differences in efficiency among the algorithms are small, differences in robustness are much more apparent. Threshold variability and peer-to-peer communication appear to be two key mechanisms for improving worker allocation robustness against environmental perturbations.},

When the intensity of a particular stimulus exceeds an individual's response threshold, the individual engages in task performance with high probability, and successful task performance reduces the intensity of the stimulus. If individuals belonging to different (physical or behavioural) castes have different response thresholds, and if thresholds are assumed to remain fixed over the timescales of experiments, this model can account for some observations on ant species of Pheidole (Wilson 1984).},

Finally, we briejly describe a platform, called {MADKITb}, ased on this model. It relies on a minimal agent kernel with platform-level services implemented as agents, groups and roles.},

Tasks that are sequentially interdependent are common in natural and artiﬁcial systems. The proposed method does neither rely on global knowledge nor centralized components. Moreover, it does not require the robots to communicate. The method is based on the delay experienced by the robots working on one subtask when waiting for input from another subtask. We explore the capabilities of the method in different simulated environments. Additionally, we evaluate the method in a proof-of-concept experiment using real robots. We show that the method allows a swarm to reach a near-optimal allocation in the studied environments, can easily be transferred to a real robot setting, and is adaptive to changes in the properties of the tasks such as their duration. Finally, we show that the ideal setting of the parameters of the method does not depend on the properties of the environment.},

We track explicitly the intake of pesticides in individual bees and their ability to metabolize these toxins, such that the impact of sub-lethal doses of pesticides can be explored. Moreover, pathogen populations (in particular, Nosema apis, Nosema cerenae and Varroa mites) have been included in the model and may be introduced at any time or location. The ability to study interactions among pesticides, climate, biodiversity and pathogens in this predictive framework should prove useful to a wide range of researchers studying honey bee populations. To this end, the simulation package is written in open source, object-oriented code (C++) and can be easily modiﬁed by the user. Here, we demonstrate the use of the model by exploring the effects of sub-lethal pesticide exposure on the ﬂight behaviour of foragers.},

It seems that the commercial honey bees of Canada are a mongrel lot, with far more variability than their ancestors in Europe.},

That the pattern is consistent and well-organized suggests its adaptive value for the colony, yet the mechanism of pattern formation has not been elucidated. Two hypotheses are presented. The blueprint (or template) hypothesis suggests that there are particular locations specified for the deposition of eggs, pollen and honey, i.e., the pattern develops as a consequence of the bees filling in the comb according to the orderly arrangement latent in the blueprint. An alternative is the "self-organization" hypothesis: pattern emerges spontaneously from dynamic interactions among the processes of depositing and removing brood, pollen and honey, without a plan specifying spatial relationships. Computer simulation of the self-organization hypothesis demonstrates how the colony-level pattern can emerge and how, using only local cues and simple behavioral rules, the bees can create an overall, global pattern of which they have no concept.},

In this article, we focus on the foraging activity, its recruitment mechanisms and the behaviour of foraging bees, and how these bees interact with the hive's environment, greatly di erent in scale. We present a customizable, agent-compliant module called the Ecosystem Module, that aims at modelling and simulating the foraging, according to the local weather and the surrounding nectar sources. First results back up our model, showing that these recruitment mechanisms lead to a self-organizing process of the best available sources' selection by the agents.},

Since this discovery, many studies have attempted to characterize the impact of this parasite in Apis mellifera honey bees. Nosema species can infect all colony members, workers, drones and queens, but the pathological effects of this microsporidium has been mainly investigated in workers, despite the prime importance of the queen, who monopolizes the reproduction and regulates the cohesion of the society via pheromones. We therefore analyzed the impact of N. ceranae on queen physiology. We found that infection by N. ceranae did not affect the fat body content (an indicator of energy stores) but did alter the vitellogenin titer (an indicator of fertility and longevity), the total antioxidant capacity and the queen mandibular pheromones, which surprisingly were all significantly increased in Nosema-infected queens. Thus, such physiological changes may impact queen health, leading to changes in pheromone production, that could explain Nosema-induced supersedure (queen replacement).},

Components achieve a simple task individually, but a complex collective behaviour emerges from their mutual interactions. Such a system modiﬁes its structure and functionality to adapt to changes to requirements and to the environment based on previous experience. Nature provides examples of self-organisation, such as ants food foraging, molecules formation, or antibodies detection. Similarly, current software applications are driven by social interactions (negotiations, transactions), based on autonomous entities or agents, and run in highly dynamic environments. The issue of engineering applications, based on the principles of selforganisation to achieve robustness and adaptability, is gaining increasing interest in the software research community. The aim of this paper is to survey natural and artiﬁcial complex systems exhibiting emergent behaviour, and to outline the mechanisms enabling such behaviours.},

This model emphasizes the role of learning in the individual. Individuals adapt to the environment using only locally available information. We show that a simple parameter adaptation is an effective way to improve the efficiency of the group and that it brings forth division of labor between the members of the group. Moreover, robots that are best at retrieving have a higher probability of becoming active retrievers. This selection of the best members does not use any explicit representation of individual capabilities. We analyze this system and point out its strengths and its weaknesses.},

Here the younger bees perform in-hive tasks such as heating and the older ones carry out tasks outside the hive such as foraging. Recently it has been shown that the higher developmental temperatures of the brood, which occur in the centre of the brood nest, reduce the age at which individuals start to forage once they are adult. It is unknown whether this effect has an impact on the survival of the colony. The aim of this paper is to study the consequences of the temperature gradient on the colony survival in a model on the basis of empirical data.},

A range from simple to complex interaction protocols is then presented. We illustrate the use of these interaction protocols for social and individual control issues in several application domains. We finally discuss our choices and future work. All this brings us at a stage where there is clearly still much work to do, but where we hope to dispose of an interesting framework, inspired by interdisciplinary studies, to approach effective Agent Oriented Programming.},

	abstract = {We present Interactive Slice {WIM}, a framework for navigating and interrogating volumetric datasets using an interface enabled by a virtual reality environment made of two display surfaces: an interactive multi-touch table, and a stereoscopic display wall. The framework addresses two current challenges in immersive visualization: (1) providing an appropriate overview+detail style of visualization while navigating through volume data, and (2) supporting interactive querying and data exploration, i.e., interrogating volume data. The approach extends the World-in-Miniature ({WIM}) metaphor, simultaneously displaying a large-scale detailed data visualization and an interactive miniature. Leveraging the table+wall hardware, horizontal slices are projected (like a shadow) down onto the table surface, providing a useful 2D data overview to complement the 3D views as well as a data context for interpreting 2D multi-touch gestures made on the table. In addition to enabling effective navigation through complex geometries, extensions to the core Slice {WIM} technique support interacting with a set of multiple slices that persist on the table even as the user navigates around a scene and annotating and measuring data via points, paths, and volumes speciﬁed using interactive slices. Applications of the interface to two volume datasets are presented, and design decisions, limitations, and user feedback are discussed.},

We explore the different challenges arising from the use of an interaction-oriented methodology such as {IODA} for modelling a realistic population of autonomous virtual characters able to behave and interact with the learner in an adaptive fashion. Our argumentation is illustrated with many examples from our own experience in the development of a {SG} application.},

	abstract = {Leveraging the abilities of multiple aﬀordable robots as a swarm is enticing because of the resulting robustness and emergent behaviors of a swarm. However, because swarms are composed of many diﬀerent agents, it is diﬃcult for a human to inﬂuence the swarm by managing individual agents. Instead, we propose that human inﬂuence should focus on (a) managing the higher level attractors of the swarm system and (b) managing trade-oﬀs that appear in mission-relevant performance. We claim that managing attractors theoretically allows a human to abstract the details of individual agents and focus on managing the collective as a whole. Using a swarm model with two attractors, we demonstrate this concept by showing how limited human inﬂuence can cause the swarm to switch between attractors. We further claim that using quorum sensing allows a human to manage tradeoﬀs between the scalability of interactions and mitigating the vulnerability of the swarm to agent failures.},

Throughout the paper, our focus is on presenting not only the available techniques but also practical guidelines for 3-D interaction design and widely held myths. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss two approaches to 3-D interaction design and some example applications with complex 3-D interaction requirements.

These physical artifacts, which we call "bricks," are essentially new input devices that can be tightly coupled or “attached” to virtual objects for manipulation or for expressing action (e.g., to set parameters or for initiating processes). Our bricks operate on top of a large horizontal display surface known as the "{ActiveDesk}." We present four stages in the development of Graspable {UIs}: (1) a series of exploratory studies on hand gestures and grasping; (2) interaction simulations using mock-ups and rapid prototyping tools; (3) a working prototype and sample application called {GraspDraw}; and (4) the initial integrating of the Graspable {UI} concepts into a commercial application. Finally, we conclude by presenting a design space for Bricks which lay the foundation for further exploring and developing Graspable User Interfaces.},

We present the Loupe, a tangible Augmented Reality prototype in form of a magnifying lens, which allows museum visitors to get information in context about museum artefacts. We detail the design and content creation process that was employed in order to create a thematic tour for the Greek Gallery of Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam. An evaluation study with 22 adult participants was carried out, using both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods, so as to explore the utility and usability of the Loupe as well its learning and affective impact. Our findings suggest that the acceptance of the Loupe as a museum interactive and learning resource, was related both with its qualities as a tangible as well as with the structure of the content and the narratives revealed.},

As minor rolls affect translation, we propose a roll correction algorithm to support stable 2D pointing with {RPM}. We propose the use of compound gestures for 3D pointing and docking, and evaluate them against a commercial 3D device, the {SpaceMouse}. Our studies reveal that {RPM} performs 31\% faster than the {SpaceMouse} for 3D pointing and equivalently for 3D rotation. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept integrated {RPM} prototype along with discussion on the various technical challenges to overcome to build a final integrated version of {RPM}.},

This environment takes benefit of Augmented Reality ({AR}) and tangible interaction to stimulate an active and learner-centered approach to scientific problem solving. This approach follows the pedagogical principles of the {InquiryBased} Sciences Education ({IBSE}). Technical specifications and the design of the application have been based on didactical principles. It is intended to children of 8 to 11 years old in formal education. {HELIOS} was tested in-situ, i.e., in real teaching conditions with pupils (grades 4-5) from two primary schools. This user study confirms the design assumptions that influence children’s interaction with contents during sciences courses. The analyses of the children’s interactions with the system as well as learning indicate that {HELIOS} supports children in their investigations. Moreover, it provides some new information on children’s interactions possibilities that will be taken into account in future versions. All these parameters contribute to the understanding of the ways through which {AR} can be used in formal teaching curricula in K-12 schools.},

	abstract = {Tangible user interfaces ({TUIs}) are often compared to graphical user interfaces ({GUIs}). However, the existing literature is unable to demonstrate clear advantages for either interface, as empirical studies yielded different ﬁndings, sometimes even contradicting ones. The current study set out to conduct an in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of both interfaces, based on a comparison between similar {TUI} and {GUI} versions of a modeling and simulation system called “{FlowBlocks}”. Results showed most users preferred the {TUI} version over the {GUI} version. This is a surprising ﬁnding, considering both versions were equivalent in regard to most performance parameters, and the {TUI} version was even perceived as inferior to the {GUI} version in regard to usability. Interviews with users revealed this preference stemmed from high levels of stimulation and enjoyment, derived from three {TUI} properties: physical interaction, rich feedback, and high levels of realism. Potential underlying mechanisms for these ﬁndings and practical implications are discussed.},

It deals with the design of visual representations aimed at making the interface in real time between human users and complex systems. Being composed of interacting entities that dynamically organize and whose evolution is emergent or chaotic, therefore potentially unpredictable, these systems can generally not be observed directly. New visualization means must therefore be developed.},
