	shorttitle = {The tremble dance of the honey bee},
	abstract = {The nectar foragers of a honey bee colony, upon return to the hive, sometimes perform a mysterious behavior called the tremble dance. In performing this dance, a forager shakes her body back and forth, at the same time rotating her body axis by about 50° every second or so, all the while walking slowly across the comb. During the course of a dance, which on average lasts 30 rain, the bee travels about the broodnest portion of the hive. It is shown experimentally that a forager will reliably perform this dance if she visits a highly profitable nectar source but upon return to the hive experiences great difficulty finding a food-storer bee to take her nectar. This suggests that the message of the tremble dance is " I have visited a rich nectar source worthy of greater exploitation, but already we have more nectar coming into the hive than we can handle." It is also shown experimentally that the performance of tremble dances is followed quickly by a rise in a colony's nectar processing capacity and (see Nieh, in press and Kirchner, submitted) by a drop in a colony's recruitment of additional bees to nectar sources. These findings suggest that the tremble dance has multiple meanings. For bees working inside the hive, its meaning is apparently "I should switch to the task of processing nectar," while for bees working outside the hive (gathering nectar), its meaning is apparently " I should refrain from recruiting additional foragers to my nectar source." Hence it appears that the tremble dance functions as a mechanism for keeping a colony's nectar processing rate matched with its nectar intake rate at times of greatly increased nectar influx. Evidently the tremble dance restores this match in part by stimulating a rise in the processing rate, and in part by inhibiting any further rise in the intake rate.},

Our special emphasis was on the decentralized, self-organized regulation of brood nursing, which we successfully simulated: We found that brood manipulations, food-deprivation experiments and colony-size manipulations can be explained by the mechanisms we implemented into our model described here. Our agents can perform various tasks (foraging, storing, nursing). The model is spatially resolved, and contains a designated broodnest area as well as a designated honey/nectar storage area. All bees (and larvae) consume nectar/honey at a task-speciﬁc rate, allowing us to track the ﬂow of nectar through the colony. Several kinds of stimuli, which are important for division of labour, were modelled in detail: dances, contact stimuli and chemical signals.},

	abstract = {La problematique generale qui oriente notre travail concerne la capacite de groupes d'agents a s'auto-organiser pour produire des reponses fonctionnelles collectives. Elle s'insere dans la problematique plus vaste de l'intelligence artificielle distribuee, qui est de faire fonctionner de maniere cooperative des agents informatiques au sein de systemes multi-agents. Nous nous interessons plus particulierement a l'emergence de ces reponses au sein de groupes d'agents non-intelligents individuellement, encore appeles agents reactifs. Ce choix necessite de comprendre les comportements individuels et inter-individuels qui permettent l'apparition et le maintien d'une dynamique collective alors meme qu'aucun agent n'est capable de penser cette dynamique. Comme les travaux theoriques portant sur l'auto-organisation ou l'emergence de proprietes sont encore loin d'etre finalises, le point de vue que nous defendons ici est qu'il est possible de s'inspirer de processus auto-organises existants pour construire des logiciels exploitant ces proprietes. Pour cela, deux types d'etudes ont ete realisees: ? une etude de simulation s'attachant a reproduire le fonctionnement d'une colonie de fourmis en utilisant un systeme reactif, ou chaque fourmi est representee dans le systeme par un agent possedant un comportement du type stimulus/reponse. Nous reproduisons fidelement, avec ce systeme totalement decentralise, la dynamique de fondation d'une societe et la structuration de l'ensemble des agents-fourmis au sein d'une division globale du travail. Outre que ces resultats nous fournissent l'occasion de montrer le large champ d'application d'une approche multi-agents de la simulation, ils peuvent etre interpretes comme la reponse fonctionnelle et auto-organisee d'un groupe d'agents aux problemes que lui pose son environnement. ?la seconde etude developpe dans le domaine de la resolution de problemes cette capacite auto-organisatrice, en s'attachant tout d'abord a extraire de la simulation realisee les paradigmes qui nous fournissent la base d'un systeme de resolution collective de problemes. Nous montrons ainsi comment concevoir des systemes reactifs capables de resoudre des problemes comme le tri collectif ou la recherche d'echantillons dans un environnement aleatoire, en s'inspirant directement des comportements des agents-fourmis de la simulation. Nous montrons ensuite qu'une approche reactive peut etre appliquee a des problemes classiques en intelligence artificielle, comme pengi et le taquin, en offrant de bien meilleurs resultats que toutes les approches precedemment employees. Nous en montrons cependant aussi les limites potentielles, notamment dans le cadre du jeu d'echecs},

The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.},

The algorithm is based on local interactions of agents and is inspired by honeybee age-polyethism. It is adaptive to changes in the swarm size (workforce) and relative demands (workload) for diﬀerent tasks and it limits the number of switchings of agents between diﬀerent tasks enabling specialization of agents. The preliminary version of the algorithm was introduced in the past. Here a fully decentralized version of the algorithm is proposed that improves the previous version by removing the need to global information. The algorithm is successfully implemented in swarms of physically-embodied underwater robots while the swarm size and the demands for the tasks change over the course of the experiments.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggested that juvenile hormone ({JH}) is involved in the regulation of physiological processes that are associated with division of labor in honey bees but the effects of {JH} on behavior were not clear. The hypothesis that {JH} affects worker age polyethism was tested by observing individually marked bees topically treated with different doses of the {JH} analog methoprene. Methoprene caused dose-dependent changes in the timing and frequency of occurrence of four important age-dependent tasks: brood and queen care, food storage, nest maintenance, and foraging. Weak or no effects were observed for social interactions, self-grooming, and other non-task behaviors that were not performed in an age-dependent manner. These results support the hypothesis that {JH} is involved in the control of age polyethism. A model is presented that explains the role of {JH} in regulating division of labor. {JH} may regulate the colony's allocation of labor by altering the probabilities of response to tasks. According to this model, hormone titers increase with age according to a genetically determined pattern of development, but this rise may be modulated by environmental and colony factors such as food availability and population structure. Extrinsic regulation of {JH} may be a mechanism underlying the ability of workers to respond to changing colony needs.},

	abstract = {As organisms develop, they first invest resources in survival and growth, but after reaching a certain condition they start to also invest in reproduction. Likewise, superorganisms, such as honey bee colonies, first invest in survival and growth, and later commit resources to reproduction once the number of workers in the colony surpasses a reproductive threshold. The first form of reproductive investment for a honey bee colony is the building of beeswax comb made of special large cells used for rearing males (drones). How do the workers sense that their colony is large enough to start building this ‘drone comb’? To address this question, we experimentally increased three possible cues of colony size – worker density, volatile pheromone concentration and nest temperature – and looked for effects on the bees’ comb construction. Only the colonies that experienced increased worker density were stimulated to build a higher proportion of drone comb. We then monitored and quantified potential cues in small and large colonies, to determine which cues change with colony size. We found that workers in large colonies, relative to small ones, have increased contact rates, spend more time active and experience less variable worker density. Whereas unicellular and multicellular organisms use mainly chemical cues to sense their sizes, our results suggest that at least one superorganism, a honey bee colony, uses physical cues to sense its size and thus its developmental state.},

A central objective in the study of honey bee sociality therefore is to understand the communication signals used to integrate behavior within and among worker groups. This paper focuses on the role of the “vibration signal” in organizing labor in honey bee colonies. The vibration signal functions as a type of “modulatory communication signal”. It is directed toward diverse recipients, causes a non-specific increase in activity that may alter responsiveness to a wide array of stimuli, and thus may influence the performance of many different tasks simultaneously. We review the empirical evidence that the signal is involved in coordinating at least three colony-level activities: food collection and foraging-dependent tasks, queen behavior during swarming and queen replacement, and house hunting by honey bee swarms. Signals that function like the vibration signal may be widespread in highly social insects and social animals in general, and may help to fine-tune the collective decision-making processes that underlie cooperative actions in a wide array of species.},

	abstract = {From ancient cave paintings of honey bee nests to modern science's richly diversified investigation of honey bee biology and its applications, the human imagination has long been captivated by the mysterious and highly sophisticated behavior of this paragon among insect societies. In the first broad treatment of honey bee biology to appear in decades, Mark Winston provides rare access to the world of this extraordinary insect. In a bright and engaging style, Winston probes the dynamics of the honey bee's social organization. He recreates for us the complex infrastructure of the nest, describes the highly specialized behavior of workers, queens, and drones, and examines in detail the remarkable ability of the honey bee colony to regulate its functions according to events within and outside the nest. Winston integrates into his discussion the results of recent studies, bringing into sharp focus topics of current bee research. These include the exquisite architecture of the nest and its relation to bee physiology; the intricate division of labor and the relevance of a temporal caste structure to efficient functioning of the colony; and, finally, the life-death struggles of swarming, supersedure, and mating that mark the reproductive cycle of the honey bee. The Biology of the Honey Bee not only reviews the basic aspects of social behavior, ecology, anatomy, physiology, and genetics, it also summarizes major controversies in contemporary honey bee research, such as the importance of kin recognition in the evolution of social behavior and the role of the well-known dance language in honey bee communication. Thorough, well-illustrated, and lucidly written, this book will for many years be a valuable resource for scholars, students, and beekeepers alike.},

Colonies were subjected to one of four requeening treatments: requeened in mid-summer with a mated, virgin or colony-reared queen, or left with the original queen (control). Worker survival in cohorts of newly emerged bees introduced to colonies in late summer and fall was followed until all marked bees had died. Winter bees were reared over a relatively similar length of time in all treatments, but they appeared earlier in control colonies compared to requeened colonies. The gradual increase in proportion of winter bees over time was similar among treatments, but requeened colonies lagged behind control colonies. The bulk of winter bees appeared much earlier in control colonies than in colonies that were requeened. This response demonstrates that cues within the colony (i.e., differences due to requeening) are perceived by workers as part of the conditions that influence summer bee or winter bee status.},

	abstract = {Homeostatic self-regulation is a fundamental aspect of open dissipative systems. Integral feedback has been found to be important for homeostatic control on both the cellular and molecular levels of biological organization and in engineered systems. Analyzing the task allocation mechanisms of three insect societies, we identified a model of integral control residing at colony level. We characterized a general functional core mechanism, called the “common stomach,” where a crucial shared substance for colony function self-regulates its own quantity via reallocating the colony’s workforce, which collects and uses this substance. The central component in a redundant feedback network is the saturation level of this substance in the colony. An interaction network of positive and negative feedback loops ensures the homeostatic state of this substance and the workforce involved in processing this substance. Extensive sensitivity and stability analyses of the core model revealed that the system is very resilient against perturbations and compensates for specific types of stress that real colonies face in their ecosystems. The core regulation system is highly scalable, and due to its buffer function, it can filter noise and find a new equilibrium quickly after environmental (supply) or colony-state (demand) changes. The common stomach regulation system is an example of convergent evolution among the three different societies, and we predict that similar integral control regulation mechanisms have evolved frequently within natural complex systems.},

	abstract = {We observed the impact of bad pollen supply (non-foraging due to arti®cial rain and pollen removal under poor-foraging conditions) on the survival of honey bee larvae, and on the total development time from egg-laying to the capping of a larval cell. Five days of non-foraging led to cannibalism of larvae younger than 3 days old and to a shortening of the time until larvae were sealed, but 4- and 5-day-old larvae survived even worse pollen supply situations. Manual pollen removal and reduction of income (pollen trap) induced cannibalism of younger larvae. The larvae's mean capping age signi®cantly correlated with the mean pollen income: the less pollen was stored by the hive during the larvae's development, the earlier the larvae were capped. Both behavioral patterns lead to a quick reduction in the amount of unsealed older brood in response to a shortage of available protein. Older larvae have the highest pollen demand, so this strategy compensates for a shortage of supply by reducing demand. Additionally worker jelly gets enriched by protein gained from cannibalism, and the early capping of older larvae saves the oldest part of the brood, which represents the highest broodcare investment.},

In this work we present Serendipity, a new technique for recognizing unremarkable and fine-motor finger gestures using integrated motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in off-the-shelf smartwatches. Our system demonstrates the potential to distinguish 5 fine-motor gestures like pinching, tapping and rubbing fingers with an average f1-score of 87\%. Our work is the first to explore the feasibility of using solely motion sensors on everyday wearable devices to detect fine-grained gestures. This promising technology can be deployed today on current smartwatches and has the potential to be applied to cross-device interactions, or as a tool for research in fields involving finger and hand motion.},

Response thresholds refer to the likelihood of reacting to task-associated stimuli. Low-threshold individuals perform tasks at a lower level of stimulus than high-threshold individuals. Within individual workers, performing a given task induces a decrease in the corresponding threshold, and not performing the task induces an increase in the threshold. This combined reinforcement process leads to the emergence of specialized workers, i.e. workers that are more responsive to stimuli associated with particular task requirements, from a group of initially identical individuals. Predictions of the dynamics of task specialization resulting from this model are presented. Predictions are also made as to what should be observed when specialists of a given task are removed from the colony and reintroduced after a varying amount of time: the colony does not recover the same state as that prior to the perturbation, and the difference between before and after the perturbation is more strongly marked as the time between separation and reintroduction increases.},

	doi = {10.1109/SASO.2019.00022},
	abstract = {Division of labor in natural systems enables resiliency in times of dynamic change. Researchers have shown that division of labor can emerge in homogeneous populations predicated on the system's environment and the distribution of agent task bias. This article demonstrates that the emergence of division of labor in homogenous populations is also impacted by agent decision functions, agent population size, and environmental constraints. Results show, one, agent decision functions and population size have a significant impact on the division of labor scores, whereas, the influence of environmental constraints depends upon the chosen agent decision function. Two, results indicate that high division of labor scores do not necessarily translate to higher resource production, which, again, appears tied to agent decision functions. Three, although agent population size possesses a positive correlation to division of labor scores, agent decision functions play a more critical role in its emergence.},

Studies of division of labor are concerned with the integration of individual worker behavior into colony level task organization and with the question of how regulation of division of labor may contribute to colony efficiency. Here we describe and critique the current models concerned with the proximate causes of division of labor in social insects. The models have identified various proximate mechanisms to explain division of labor, based on both internal and external factors. On the basis of these factors, we suggest a classification of the models. We first describe the different types of models and then review the empirical evidence supporting them. The models to date may be considered preliminary and exploratory; they have advanced our understanding by suggesting possible mechanisms for division of labor and by revealing how individual and colony-level behavior may be related. They suggest specific hypotheses that can be tested by experiment and so may lead to the development of more powerful and integrative explanatory models.},

It generalizes the traditional ﬁeld of active learning, and is related to old, but less formal ideas in aesthetics theory and developmental psychology. It has been argued that the theory explains many essential aspects of intelligence including autonomous development, science, art, music, and humor. This overview ﬁrst describes theoretically optimal (but not necessarily practical) ways of implementing the basic computational principles on exploratory, intrinsically motivated agents or robots, encouraging them to provoke event sequences exhibiting previously unknown, but learnable algorithmic regularities. Emphasis is put on the importance of limited computational resources for online prediction and compression. Discrete and continuous time formulations are given. Previous practical, but nonoptimal implementations (1991, 1995, and 1997–2002) are reviewed, as well as several recent variants by others (2005–2010). A simpliﬁed typology addresses current confusion concerning the precise nature of intrinsic motivation.},

Alife approaches to the origins and emergence of language typically manage this complexity by carefully staging the learning paths that embodied artiﬁcial agents need to follow in order to bootstrap their own communication system from scratch. This paper investigates how these scaffolds introduced by the experimenter can be removed by allowing agents to autonomously set their own challenges when they are driven by intrinsic motivation and have the capacity to self-assess their own skills at achieving their communicative goals. The results suggest that intrinsic motivation not only allows agents to spontaneously develop their own learning paths, but also that they are able to make faster transitions from one learning phase to the next.},

	abstract = {The goal of my work is to develop and implement an architecture for an autonomous agent, which I refer to as "{ANA}'. An {ANA} agent consists of a distributed set of "competence modules". Competence modules are linked in a network. A spreading activation process operates on the network to decide what the "relevance" or relative strength of a competence module is in the current context. This process implements a competition among modules for activation energy. The higher the activation energy level of a module, the more likely it is that this module determines what the autonomous agent does or communicates to believe. Learning is a central, completely integrated feature of the architecture. The competence module network is continuously being developed and changed on the basis of experience: links are added and deleted depending on real world observations and new "macro modules" are created whenever a goal is achieved. This paper presents an overview of the architecture. It describes the functionalities that have been implemented, the results that have been obtained with robotic and simulated {ANA} agents, and finally it discusses (current) limitations and future work.},

While the ability of the commonly used reactive techniques to express agent speciﬁcations is roughly equivalent, the authorial burden of constructing these speciﬁcations varies. In practice, this means that identical agent behavior may be more difﬁcult to create in some architectures than others. In this paper we introduce the notion of representational complexity that relates to the authorial burden of constructing such agents and theoretically compare the representational complexity of ﬁnite state machines, behavior trees, and subsumption architectures. Our key ﬁnding is that hierarchical subsumption architectures have signiﬁcantly lower representational complexity as compared to hierarchical ﬁnite state machines and behavior trees, which makes subsumption the best choice when developing authoring tools for non-expert users.},

In a subsequent paper, {KOLMES}(1985) stated that “honey bees do not appear to pass through a temporal sequence of tasks while performing hive duties” and that previous findings of this age polyethism are due to subjective interpretations of data. Here we report new behavioral data and statistical analyses substantiating the claim that age polyethism exists in bees working inside the hive. We followed a cohort of bees until they were 15 days old; they underwent two behavioral transitions. The first took place when the bees were approximately 3-4 d old and was associated with a switch from cell cleaning to other activities, mainly in the broodnest. The second occurred when the bees were approximately 10-12 d old and was associated with a switch from brood care to food-storage activities and foraging. Thus we present strong statistical evidence of a cellcleaning age caste and a brood-care age caste for bees, but further evidence is needed to demonstrate fully that bees also pass through a distinct food-storage age caste before starting to work outside the hive. In addition, we demonstrate that {KOLMES}’Sprevious denial of age polyethism in hive workers was caused neither by unusual behavior of his bees nor by weakness of his Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test, but by sampling errors due to a small but critical flaw in his method of labelling bees.},

	abstract = {Homeostatic self-regulation is a fundamental aspect of open dissipative systems. Integral feedback has been found to be important for homeostatic control on both the cellular and molecular levels of biological organization and in engineered systems. Analyzing the task allocation mechanisms of three insect societies, we identified a model of integral control residing at colony level. We characterized a general functional core mechanism, called the “common stomach,” where a crucial shared substance for colony function self-regulates its own quantity via reallocating the colony’s workforce, which collects and uses this substance. The central component in a redundant feedback network is the saturation level of this substance in the colony. An interaction network of positive and negative feedback loops ensures the homeostatic state of this substance and the workforce involved in processing this substance. Extensive sensitivity and stability analyses of the core model revealed that the system is very resilient against perturbations and compensates for specific types of stress that real colonies face in their ecosystems. The core regulation system is highly scalable, and due to its buffer function, it can filter noise and find a new equilibrium quickly after environmental (supply) or colony-state (demand) changes. The common stomach regulation system is an example of convergent evolution among the three different societies, and we predict that similar integral control regulation mechanisms have evolved frequently within natural complex systems.},

We conducted a user study to compare the task performance and user experience of {HoloBee} with a conventional desktop application. The results show that {HoloBee} allows for solving tasks in a similar time and accuracy compared to the desktop interface, despite participants’ having signiﬁcantly more experience interacting with a desktop interface. We received positive feedback from a subset of participants on the natural and intuitive interactions that {HoloBee} provides, while others preferred using the desktop application.

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.},

	abstract = {Effective data visualization is a key part of the discovery process in the era of “big data”. It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path from data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional “desktop” visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.},

The algorithm is fully distributed and solely based on the local perceptions of the individuals. Each agent decides autonomously and deterministically to work only when it “feels” that some work needs to be done based on its sensory inputs. In this paper, we applied the worker allocation algorithm to a collective manipulation case study concerned with the gathering and clustering of initially scattered small objects. The aggregation experiment has been studied at three different experimental levels by using macroscopic and microscopic probabilistic models, and embodied simulations. Results show that teams using a number of active workers dynamically controlled by the allocation algorithm achieve similar or better performances in aggregation than those characterized by a constant team size, while using a considerably reduced number of agents over the whole aggregation process. Since this algorithm does not imply any form of explicit communication among agents, it represents a cost-effective solution for controlling the number of active workers in embedded systems consisting of a few to thousands of units.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present three scalable, fully distributed, threshold-based algorithms for allocating autonomous embodied workers to a given task whose demand evolves dynamically over time. Individuals estimate the availability of work based solely on local perceptions. The differences among the algorithms lie in the threshold distribution among teammates (homogeneous or heterogeneous team), in the mechanism used for establishing threshold values (fixed, parameter-based or variable, rule-based), and in the sharing (public) or not sharing (private) of demand estimations through local peer-to-peer communication. We tested the algorithms’ efficiency and robustness in a collective manipulation case study concerned with the clustering of initially scattered small objects. The aggregation experiment has been studied at two different experimental levels using a microscopic model and embodied simulations. Results show that teams using a number of active workers dynamically controlled by one of the allocation algorithms achieve similar or better performances in aggregation than those characterized by a constant team size while using on average a considerably reduced number of agents over the whole aggregation process. While differences in efficiency among the algorithms are small, differences in robustness are much more apparent. Threshold variability and peer-to-peer communication appear to be two key mechanisms for improving worker allocation robustness against environmental perturbations.},

When the intensity of a particular stimulus exceeds an individual's response threshold, the individual engages in task performance with high probability, and successful task performance reduces the intensity of the stimulus. If individuals belonging to different (physical or behavioural) castes have different response thresholds, and if thresholds are assumed to remain fixed over the timescales of experiments, this model can account for some observations on ant species of Pheidole (Wilson 1984).},

	abstract = {Since 2006, disastrous colony losses have been reported in Europe and North America. The causes of the losses were not readily apparent and have been attributed to overwintering mortalities and to a new phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single explanation for the extensive colony losses but that interactions between diﬀerent stresses are involved. As the presence of Varroa in each colony places an important pressure on bee health, we here address the question of how Varroa contributes to the recent surge in honey bee colony losses.},

	abstract = {In this article we present a self-organized method for allocating the individuals of a robot swarm to tasks that are sequentially interdependent. Tasks that are sequentially interdependent are common in natural and artiﬁcial systems. The proposed method does neither rely on global knowledge nor centralized components. Moreover, it does not require the robots to communicate. The method is based on the delay experienced by the robots working on one subtask when waiting for input from another subtask. We explore the capabilities of the method in different simulated environments. Additionally, we evaluate the method in a proof-of-concept experiment using real robots. We show that the method allows a swarm to reach a near-optimal allocation in the studied environments, can easily be transferred to a real robot setting, and is adaptive to changes in the properties of the tasks such as their duration. Finally, we show that the ideal setting of the parameters of the method does not depend on the properties of the environment.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of eusocial insects differ signiﬁcantly from those of non-eusocial animals. With eusocial insects, one has to distinguish between a population of colonies and the population of individuals inside each colony. These two levels are closely related, because the decision whether a colony reproduces or not is mainly determined by its intracolonial population and resource status. In addition, a population’s rate of colony mortality is strongly dependent on each colony’s intracolonial status. Honeybees collect their food in the environment, their most important ecological aspect is the pollinating of plants. In recent empirical studies, we demonstrated the importance of food supply on the population dynamics of honeybee colonies. In addition, honeybees show division of labor, which occurs in the form of age polyethism, meaning that morphologically almost identical worker bees choose their tasks mainly dependent on age. This task selection system is very ﬂexible and is signiﬁcantly affected by changes in task-speciﬁc workloads or in the age structure of the colony. Recent studies have shown that environmental factors and/or natural or experimental changes in resource supply heavily affect the age structure, resulting in changes in task allocation within the colony. These changes further affect the intracolony population dynamics and age structure. This situation can be described as a set of delayed feedback loops. We created a mathematically simple honeybee population model ({HoPoMo}) using difference equations to model the population dynamics and the resource dynamics of a honeybee colony. Our model emphasizes the importance of pollen supply and of brood cannibalism, an aspect that was neglected by other honeybee population models so far. {HoPoMo} includes simple models of task selection and of nutrient allocation. It allows us to simulate a variety of colony conditions (colony size, intrinsic bee characteristics, resource status) and a variety of environmental conditions (rain, temperature, botanical resource availability). The model can be easily parameterized with real weather data and with experimental colony treatments, so that we can use the model to interpret empirical experimental data. We successfully compared the predictions of our model with data gained from the literature and from own experiments. Extensive sensitivity analysis revealed that the model’s predictions of population dynamics are very stable, except at very low mortality rates. And ﬁnally, we demonstrate, that the model can be used for several environmental conditions of honeybee living: controlled bee hives, scientiﬁcally used colonies and wild-life honeybees.},

	abstract = {We present a model and associated simulation package (www.beeplusplus.ca) to capture the natural dynamics of a honey bee colony in a spatially-explicit landscape, with temporally-variable, weather-dependent parameters. The simulation tracks bees of different ages and castes, food stores within the colony, pollen and nectar sources and the spatial position of individual foragers outside the hive. We track explicitly the intake of pesticides in individual bees and their ability to metabolize these toxins, such that the impact of sub-lethal doses of pesticides can be explored. Moreover, pathogen populations (in particular, Nosema apis, Nosema cerenae and Varroa mites) have been included in the model and may be introduced at any time or location. The ability to study interactions among pesticides, climate, biodiversity and pathogens in this predictive framework should prove useful to a wide range of researchers studying honey bee populations. To this end, the simulation package is written in open source, object-oriented code (C++) and can be easily modiﬁed by the user. Here, we demonstrate the use of the model by exploring the effects of sub-lethal pesticide exposure on the ﬂight behaviour of foragers.},

It seems that the commercial honey bees of Canada are a mongrel lot, with far more variability than their ancestors in Europe.},
